# Measure App

The **Measure App** is a mobile Flutter application designed to work seamlessly with a physical **measure mat**. It collects body measurement data and sends it to a database for further processing and analysis.

## 📱 About the App

This app is intended for use with a physical mat that includes sensors and a laser measurement system. Users are guided through a short onboarding process when opening the app for the first time. The app:

- Ensures users stand on the mat with the correct posture
- Verifies position using the mat’s built-in sensors
- Triggers a laser-based system to accurately measure the user’s height
- Sends the collected data to a remote database

## 🧭 Features

- First-time user guide to prepare for mat usage
- Real-time posture verification through AI-model
- Laser-based height measurement
- Sensor-based weight measurement
- Seamless data transmission to a backend system
- Simple and intuitive Flutter UI
